# Readwise Markdown Cleanup

---

## 📌 Intent
Fixes broken line breaks and formatting issues that occur when highlights from Apple Books are extracted by Readwise and then synced into markdown-based apps like Obsidian or Notion. This script focuses specifically on highlight formatting artifacts caused during this extraction and sync process.

- Preserves Obsidian-specific formatting like callouts (`> [!note]`), tags, and blockquotes.

---

## ⚙️ Actions
List the primary functions or operations this project performs. What does it actually do?
- Detects and merges broken multi-line highlights into a single paragraph
- Preserves associated `Tags:` and `Note:` sub-bullets
- Avoids modifying YAML front matter or any other non-highlight content
- Operates only on expected highlight structures typical of `Apple Books > Readwise > Obsidian` export chain

- Skips lines starting with Markdown syntax characters (`#`, `!`, `[`, `*`, `>`) to avoid corrupting headings, images, and callouts.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

List common problems and their solutions.

### 🟥 Problem: File doesn't update after running script

✅ Make sure you're passing the correct `.md` file path to the script.

### 🟥 Problem: Script removes intentional line breaks

✅ This cleaner is only intended for Apple Books highlights. Use cautiously on manually formatted notes.

### 🟥 Problem: I want to preview changes before overwriting

✅ Make a copy of your markdown file or use git to track file changes.

### 🟥 Problem: Obsidian callouts or metadata formatting breaks after cleanup

✅ The script now skips any line starting with `>` and other special characters to preserve Obsidian callouts and metadata. If you're seeing issues, make sure you're running the latest version.
